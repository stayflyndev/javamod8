Gaming Room wants to extend their Android game to a Web application Game "Draw it or Lose it". The best option to expand is using an open source OS like Linux to have more control over development.

What I did well was understanding the full scope of what the appliaction would require in order to determing the resources that would be needed to complete the project.
---
Breaking down the design into different sections was helpful. For instance, having a table that allows me to compare different OS, resources, hardware, cost within one table allows me to analyze the pros and cons of the architecture.

I would not miss completing project one that involved more code solving. The only reason it was skipped was unintentionally forgetting the assignment. This would have been helpful to complete for overall practice.

The way to interpret the customers needs is to visualize yourself as the customer. As well, to not think in a technial way because more people are not technical to the degree of developing an application. Therfore would want to understand what a customer would want and need and it is feasible and logical. The application isn't a personal product but a product that is expecting some sort of ROI so would need to think about what the customer would want and how to deliver that.

The most important part is to not assume and ask questions and eloborate on details. Making sure that I fully understand the scope of the project will allow me to determine what research I need to do, and be aware of what I already know. I would be able to avoid doing work that the customer did not actually want or care for if I have the full scope of the project by making sure I have all questions answered. One of the important things I would consider first is the budget. Building applications and explaining the cost to people can be surprising, but figuring out how to explain why the development would cost x amount of dollars.
